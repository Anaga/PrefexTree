I came to typhoid fever—read the symptoms—discovered that I had typhoid fever, 
must have had it for months without knowing it—wondered what else I had got; 
turned up St. Vitus’s Dance
—found, as I expected, that I had that too,
—began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically
—read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.
